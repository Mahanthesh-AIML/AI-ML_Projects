# Industrial AI Projects ‚Äì Chamber Pressure Stability & Tool Wear Prediction

This repository showcases two applied machine learning projects focused on predictive analytics for semiconductor and CNC manufacturing systems.

Both projects demonstrate how domain-driven feature engineering and interpretable ML improve equipment reliability, yield, and process consistency.

## üß† Project 1 ‚Äì Chamber Pressure Stability

### Overview
Predicts whether a semiconductor process chamber will remain pressure-stable during etch or deposition.  
Even minor drifts (¬±2 mTorr) can cause wafer defects or yield loss.  
This model forecasts instability from process variables before it happens.

### Approach
1. **Data Cleaning** ‚Äì Median imputation and outlier clipping (IQR)  
2. **Feature Engineering** ‚Äì  
   - Gas ratios (`O‚ÇÇ/CF‚ÇÑ`, `Ar/CF‚ÇÑ`)  
   - Pump efficiency and valve normalization  
   - Flow balance and instability index  
3. **Modeling** ‚Äì Linear ‚Üí Random Forest ‚Üí XGBoost ‚Üí Gradient Boosting  
4. **Evaluation** ‚Äì RMSE, MAE, and R¬≤ metrics  
5. **Interpretation** ‚Äì SHAP analysis confirms domain logic:  
   high `O‚ÇÇ/CF‚ÇÑ` ratios and closed valves often destabilize pressure.

### Deliverables
